# simplest-starter
A very simple starter for small js apps, no build step required.

-  [preact](https://preactjs.com/) for state & event handling
-  [htm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htm) for jsx-like syntax

---

## Usage

1. Hit "Use this template" above, or just fork/clone this repo.
2. Edit the Preact code in `index.js`.
3. Serve the static files somewhere. (Github Pages picks them up nicely by default - see [demo](https://lukestorry.github.io/simplest-starter))

If Netlify is your JAM, hit this to one-click fork & deploy:

### Development tips:
 - `npx servor --browse --reload` will launch a hot-reloading local [servor](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor).
 - VSCode has nice auto-formatting.
